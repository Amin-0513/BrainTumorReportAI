# BrainTumorReportAI
"This repository contains a production-ready deep learning system designed for automated analysis of brain MRI and CT scans. It integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) for high-accuracy tumor detection with state-of-the-art explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide transparent and interpretable predictions. The system not only classifies and localizes tumors but also generates detailed, clinically-oriented reports, assisting radiologists and medical professionals in making informed decisions. With a focus on reliability, interpretability, and real-world applicability, this framework bridges the gap between advanced AI models and practical clinical deployment for brain tumor diagnosis and monitoring."
